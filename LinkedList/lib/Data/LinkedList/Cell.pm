=cut

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

constructor. reguire one argument (not necessary) as data.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $next = undef;
    my $data = shift;
    bless { next => $next, data => $data }, $class;
}

=head2 data

accessor for data.
data method is readble and writable as below.
thid method is provided by Class::Accessor.

    $self->data;  # read
    $self->data('some data') # write

=cut

=head2 next

accessor for next cell of the LinkedList.
next method is readble and writable as below.
thid method is provided by Class::Accessor.

    $self->next;  # read
    $self->next($next_cell) # write

a user doesn't usually use this method directly.

=cut

=head2 compare_to

This method compares to value of self and it by argument.
If self value is big, this method return 1 and if it isn't so return 0.
Each cell is lined in the sorted state at the value in Data::LinkedList. it's used for the sorting.
You can use any data as value of cell.
If scalar data you use, this method compares like dictionary.
If object data you use, you have to make orignal class and implement compare_to method.

=cut

sub compare_to {
    my $self = shift;
    my $cell = shift;

    # some object case
    if (blessed($self->data)) {
        # you have to implement compare_to method in your obj
        if (!$cell->can('compare_to')) {
            croak "You have to implement compare_to method in your object(" . ref($cell) . ").\n";
        }
        return $cell->compare_to($self->data) > 0 ? 1 : 0;
    }

    if (looks_like_number($self->data) && looks_like_number($cell->data)) {
        # number case
        return $self->data > $cell->data ? 1 : 0;
    } else {
        # string case
        return $self->data gt $cell->data ? 1 : 0;
    }

    # other case (havn't implemented)
    return 1;
}
